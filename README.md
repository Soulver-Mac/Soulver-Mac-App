It allows you to write out thoughts, calculations, and ideas naturally—as you would in a notepad—while instantly providing accurate numerical results. This blend of text and math creates a smarter, more human approach to problem-solving.  

Unlike ordinary calculators, Soulver turns complex calculations into clear, understandable expressions. You can use **sentences, variables, and natural phrasing** to perform quick computations, compare results, or explore what-if scenarios. It’s perfect for planning finances, estimating projects, analyzing data, or solving everyday math problems.  

The newest version, **Soulver 3**, introduces a cleaner, faster interface built exclusively for macOS and iOS. It includes **automatic currency conversion**, **smart percentage detection**, **unit math**, and **live references**, all within a distraction-free workspace. The app also syncs effortlessly through iCloud, giving you continuous access to your notes and results on any Apple device.  

Soulver is not just a calculator—it’s a powerful thinking tool. By combining plain text with real-time computation, it helps users express ideas mathematically without the limitations of spreadsheets or traditional math tools. It’s fast, flexible, and remarkably easy to use, making number work feel natural and intuitive.
